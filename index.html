                My name is Arthur. Bocchi is literally me. No other character
                can come close to relating to me like her. There is no way you
                can convince me that I’m not Bocchi. Bocchi could not possibly
                be any more me. It’s me, and nobody can convince me otherwise.
                If anyone approached me about this not possibly being me, I
                immediately shut them down with overwhelming evidence that
                Bocchi was me. Bocchi is absolutely me; it is indisputable. Why
                anyone would try to argue that Bocchi is not me is beyond me. If
                you held two pictures of me and Bocchi side by side, you’d see
                no difference. I can safely look at Bocchi every day and say,
                “Yup, she’s me.” I can practically see Bocchi whenever I look at
                myself in the mirror. I go outside, and people stop me from
                commenting on how similar I look and act as Bocchi is. I chuckle
                softly as I’m assured every day Bocchi is me in every way. I can
                smile each time I get out of bed each morning, knowing that I’ve
                found my identity with Bocchi and I know my place in this world.
                It’s amusing how similar she is to me; it’s almost like
                identical twins. When I first saw Bocchi, I had an existential
                crisis. What it Bocchi was the real me and I was the fictional
                being? What if she actually became aware of my existence? Did
                she have the ability to become self-aware? Bocchi and I are one
                and the same. No other, out of all heroes, fiends, fools,
                queens, living and undead, I only find myself relating to
                Bocchi. Many have tried, many will try, and yet many have
                failed, and many will fail to stir my mind and dissuade me into
                considering I am not Bocchi. In all but name, Bocchi is my equal
                in every aspect, and she is incapable of being anything more
                like me-- and I incapable of being more like she. Bocchi is I,
                and none can prove anything but that. Were one to advance
                towards me and suggest the inconceivable notion that I am not
                Bocchi, with utmost haste, their claims would be silenced once
                they gaze upon the overwhelming pool of truth of Bocchi and I
                being the same, for 'tis undisputable; Bocchi is certainly I, I
                who cannot comprehend why one would waste breath and energy to
                claim that Bocchi is seperate from me. Doth thou compare a
                depiction of Bocchi and a depiction of myself, there would be
                not a single discrepancy. With an undying certainty, I am able
                to look at Bocchi at any time, and with no hesitation, speaketh
                "Verily, she is me". When mine eyes behold mine reflection,
                Bocchi greets me with the same stare. Whenst I venture forth,
                brigands prevent me from remarking on how Bocchi and I breathe
                the same air and tread the same grass. If I do not guffaw
                loudly, I chuckle softly as it is assured daily that Bocchi is
                I, in every imaginable way. I awaken each morn with a grin,
                content in knowing who I am, and who Bocchi is, and that she and
                I have found mine place on this pitiful earth. It is
                entertainingly curious how she is to I how I am to her, as
                though we were babes from the same womb. Upon the first time
                mine eyes laid upon Bocchi the Rock, mine mind itself was Rocked
                by the Bocchi to its core. Lo, I felt as though-- nay, I thought
                as though-- nay, I knew-- Bocchi was the true I, and I was
                merely a work of fiction. I ponder to myself on what would occur
                were she aware of mine being. Mayhaps she has the ability to
                know her own existence, not of that as a work of fiction, but as
                a work of fiction knowing she is a work of fiction?
